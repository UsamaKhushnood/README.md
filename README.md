# Hello, I'm Usama Khushnood!

I'm a frontend developer with 3 years of experience in Vue.js and Nuxt. I specialize in creating responsive and pixel-perfect user interfaces from Figma designs, and integrating Vuex for state management.

In my previous projects, I have worked on various Vue.js/Nuxt projects, including e-commerce websites like Deadstock.ca. I have experience in building complex UI designs and integrating APIs to provide a seamless user experience. I take pride in my ability to create high-quality code and delivering projects on time.

In addition to my technical skills, I am a team player who enjoys collaborating with others to create innovative solutions. I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.

## My skills include:
* Vue.js
* Nuxt.js
* Vuex
* HTML/CSS
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript
* Figma
* Git
* and more!

## Some of my notable projects include:
* [Deadstock.ca](https://deadstock-v2-dev.deadstock.co/): An e-commerce website built with Nuxt.js that sells limited-edition sneakers and streetwear. I was responsible for implementing the frontend design and integrating the API for whole project.
* [Cy-b3lla](https://cy-b3lle.netlify.app/): I had the privilege of spearheading the development of CY-b3lla, an NFT showcase website for Bella Hadid. As the lead developer, I created the website from scratch using Nuxt.js, and was responsible for the entire UI design. It was an exciting opportunity to showcase my skills in both front-end development and design, and I am proud of the results we achieved as a team.
* [SmartSign](https://www.smartsign.com/): I had the opportunity to work with SmartSign, a Dubai-based company, where I contributed to the development of their admin dashboard. I was responsible for implementing advanced features such as Vuex store management and API integrations using Nuxt and Vuetify. It was a challenging and rewarding experience that allowed me to deepen my understanding of Vue.js and its related technologies.

## Fun Fact :smile:
Although I started my development journey as an Angular developer, I have not had the opportunity to work on an Angular project yet. Instead, I began working with Vue.js because of its similarities to Angular. I was drawn to Vue.js because of its ease of use and simplicity, which allowed me to quickly adapt to the framework and become proficient in it. As a result, I have been able to apply my skills and knowledge in Vue.js to create high-quality and dynamic web applications.
